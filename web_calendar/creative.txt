Description: 
1) We added the ability to share your calendar with another user. You input the username of the person you want to share your calendar with (called User2 from here on)
and press the share calendar button. User2 will now see all of your events with (Shared) in front of the name of the event to show that it is a shared
event. We achieved this by creating a seperate table titled "shared events" that stores User2's username and all of the event IDs of your events. In order to show
User2 your event's information we ran a join query between the events table and the shared events table to print out all of the rows in the shared events table 
that have User2's username and the event information from the events table.

2) We added the functionality to tag events and only display certained tagged events. You can choose to add a tag when creating an event or add on later. 
You can show events from one tag by inputing the tag name and click show tagged events. You can switch back to seeing all events simply by clicking the see 
all events button. You can also drop a tag from an event.
